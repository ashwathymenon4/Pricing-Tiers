# Price Tiers
Price Tiers Project is a responsive static web-page that resembles a sample of the price-tier pages of the larger web-applications.

The web-page components will re-arrange automatically based on the screen/window size.

**NOTE** : The button components are sample placeholders and are currently not meant to redirect to any pages or initiate a submit action.
